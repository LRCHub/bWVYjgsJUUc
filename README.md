[00:06.94] What waits for you?
[00:09.41] What's breaking through?
[00:12.05] Nothing for good
[00:14.60] You're sure it's true
[00:25.10] 
[00:16.98] 永遠なんてないと言い切ってしまったら
[00:20.66] あまりにも寂しくて 切ないでしょ？
[00:26.48] 誰もが本当は信じたいけど
[00:31.34] 裏切られれば深く傷ついてしまうモノ
[00:36.18] 永遠がある世界が理想ではなく
[00:38.72] ソレを信じ 続けている姿
[00:41.15] それこそ僕らが望むべき世界 と気づくことができたなら
[00:54.15] 
[00:47.86] What will we have?
[00:56.86] 
[00:52.41] Believe that time is always forever
[00:57.25] And I'll always be here
[00:59.75] Believe it till the end
[01:02.53] I won't go away and won't say never
[01:07.38] It doesn't have to be friend
[01:10.04] You can keep it till the end
[01:24.04] 
[01:11.19] ためしに永遠なんて無いと言い切ろう
[01:16.12] そしたら希望や夢はいくつ死ぬだろう
[01:21.24] ソレが存在しない事の絶望と
[01:23.48] 存在する事の残酷を
[01:25.95] 想像してみて僕は少しまた
[01:28.63] めくるページの手を止める
[01:32.73] How will we have?
[01:41.23] 
[01:37.38] Believe that time is always forever
[01:42.25] And I'll always be here
[01:45.05] Believe it till the end
[01:47.27] I won't go away and won't say never
[01:52.32] It doesn't have to be friend
[01:54.91] You can keep it till the end
[02:08.91] 
[02:49.71] Believe that time is always forever
[02:54.74] And I'll always be here
[02:57.56] Believe it till the end
[03:00.02] I won't go away and won't say never
[03:04.82] It doesn't have to be friend
[03:07.43] You can keep it till the end
[03:21.43] 
[03:12.51] Can keep it till the end
[03:17.57] You can keep it till the end (And the time will stay)
[03:22.72] You can keep it till the end (Time goes by)
[03:27.43] You can keep it till the end
